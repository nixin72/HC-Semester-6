# PEA-PhilipDumaresq-2018
This is my Program Exit Assessment for graduation in May 2018. 

This website will serve to convince the Computer Science department that I have learned and am capable of demonstrating all of the competencies that have been covered in the past 3 years. It serves to document my knowledge across all of the disceplines that have been covered by this program, as well as to demonstrate my ability in designing and implementing responsive web applications. 

# What follows is content required by the Computer Science department at Heritage College. 
Rational for colour choices:
	- The colour scheme I chose is similar to the one I used at work this summer
	- I don't have access to the system that I developed on, so I tried to replicate it, and ended up with what I have

Rational for banner design:
	- My banner is pretty simple, it includes all of the required information, and displays it in a clean 
		and organized way. In mobile, I can simple collaprse the navigation portion of the banner into a 
		hamburger menu, keeping a similar look but making it mobile friendly.
	- In a future version, I want to make my banner respond to scrolling by making the actual banner disapear when
		the user scrolls down but keeping the navigation visible at all times to the user.
	
How CSS3 features were used:
	- I used CSS and the Bootstrap library for designing the webpage. A lot of the CSS involved is overriding 
		and changing default bootstrap styles to make things behave the way I want it all to. 
	- I used CSS3 media queries to make my website mobile responsive. I made it so that it responds to changes
		in screen size at each different breakpoint using the CSS3 media query feature. 
	
Tools used to create the site:
	- I used the bootstrap library for all of my default CSS styling, but then went and overrode parts of 
		it in my own stylesheets.
	- I used the JavaScript jQuery library to simplify a lot of my JavaScript code when accessing and manipulating 
		the DOM, although I might be pulling jQuery from this in the future since I'm not actually using it for 
		anything particularly complicated. 
	- The entire development of the site is being done in notepad++.
	- I used paint and gimp to create my favicon and logo.
